This will be a log of what I try to make CI work

I added a deploy section to my travis.yml
    added pages to provider to push results to github
    skip_cleanup to tue otherwise might delete all files
    added a github token
    told it to keep the history
    And specified the branch it would be used on

Success! I was successful in triggering Travis finally

I am now creating a simple python file to test if Travis will handle it accordingly
    python file is a hello world file
    changed branch on the travis config to ContinuousIntegrationTesting
    (I might remove the branch portion later )
